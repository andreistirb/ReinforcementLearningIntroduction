# Question
Suppose the reinforcement learning player was greedy, that is, it always
played the move that brought it to the position that it rated the best. Might it learn to play better, or
worse, than a nongreedy player? What problems might occur?

# Answer
Thinking in a Markov Decision Problem way where only the present counts, I think that a greedy approach is the best approach.
But if we would consider a whole sequence of states, it might not be the best choice because we might miss a value that on long-term might 
prove better
